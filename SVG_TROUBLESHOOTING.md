# SVG Loading Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: E-commerce Architecture SVG not displaying

### Current Status:
✅ SVG file exists at: `frontend/public/ecommerce_architecture.svg`
✅ Code updated with multiple fallback approaches
✅ Error handling and debugging added

### Solutions to Try:

#### 1. **Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

#### 2. **Verify File Location**
Ensure the file is exactly at: `frontend/public/ecommerce_architecture.svg`

#### 3. **Check Browser Console**
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for error messages:
- Look for "✅ SVG loaded successfully" (success)
- Look for "❌ Failed to load SVG" (error with details)

#### 4. **Test Direct Access**
Try accessing the SVG directly in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/ecommerce_architecture.svg
```

#### 5. **Alternative File Paths**
The code now tries these paths in order:
1. `/ecommerce_architecture.svg` (primary)
2. `./ecommerce_architecture.svg` (relative)
3. `../public/ecommerce_architecture.svg` (relative to public)
4. `ecommerce_architecture.svg` (filename only)

#### 6. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely

#### 7. **Check File Permissions**
Ensure the SVG file has proper read permissions.

### Debug Information:
The updated code now includes:
- Console logging for success/failure
- Multiple path attempts
- Detailed error messages
- Fallback UI if all paths fail

### Expected Result:
You should see the professional E-commerce architecture diagram with:
- Client Applications (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- Next.js Application (Frontend + API + Auth)
- Core Services (Product, Cart, Order, Payment, Auth)
- Data & External Services (PostgreSQL, Stripe, Cloudinary, Resend, Vercel)

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the development server is running
3. Ensure the file path is correct
4. Try accessing the SVG directly in the browser
5. Check if there are any CORS or security restrictions
