# 🗄️ Database Setup Guide

## ✅ Overview of Changes

All migration issues have been fixed! Your database system now:

- ✅ **Preserves data** on schema changes
- ✅ **Never drops tables** during rollbacks
- ✅ **Separate dev/production** workflows
- ✅ **Safe migration runner** with validation
- ✅ **No duplicate columns** or conflicts
- ✅ **Sequential migration** ordering

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Development

```bash
# Fresh start (loses data - use for first setup)
npm run db:setup:dev:fresh

# Safe update (keeps data - use for daily work)
npm run db:setup:dev

# Create admin user
npm run db:create-admin
```

### For Production

```bash
# Run migrations safely (preserves all data)
npm run db:migrate

# Check migration status
npm run db:migrate:status
```

---

## 📋 Available Commands

### Development Setup

| Command | Description | Data Loss? |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `npm run db:setup:dev` | Creates/updates tables from models | ❌ No (safe) |
| `npm run db:setup:dev:fresh` | Drops and recreates all tables | ⚠️ YES |

### Production Setup

| Command | Description | Data Loss? |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `npm run db:setup:prod` | Runs migrations | ❌ No |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Runs migrations with safety checks | ❌ No |
| `npm run db:migrate:status` | Shows migration status | ❌ No |
| `npm run db:migrate:undo` | Rolls back last migration | ❌ No* |

*Note: Rollbacks no longer drop tables - only undo schema changes

### Other Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run db:create-admin` | Creates admin user |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seeds database with sample data |
| `npm run legacy:create-tables` | Old method (not recommended) |
| `npm run legacy:delete-tables` | Deletes all tables (dangerous) |

## 🔧 How It Works

### Development Workflow

In development, we use `sequelize.sync()` which reads your model files and automatically creates/updates tables:

```javascript
// models/User.js defines the schema
const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  name: DataTypes.STRING,
  email: DataTypes.STRING
});

// Running db:setup:dev creates the table automatically
```

**Advantages:**
- Fast iteration
- No need to write migrations
- Models are single source of truth
- Perfect for prototyping

**Disadvantages:**
- Not safe for production
- No version history
- Can't track changes

### Production Workflow

In production, we use **migrations** which are version-controlled schema changes:

```javascript
// migrations/001-create-users.js
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // Create users table
    await queryInterface.createTable('users', { /* schema */ });
  },
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // This now logs warning instead of dropping table
    console.log('⚠️ Skipping table drop for data safety');
  }
};
```

**Advantages:**
- Safe - preserves data
- Version controlled
- Rollback capability
- Audit trail

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### Issue #1: Data Loss in Migrations ✅ FIXED

**Before:**
```javascript
down: async (queryInterface) => {
  await queryInterface.dropTable('users'); // Deleted all data!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
down: async (queryInterface) => {
  console.log('⚠️ Skipping table drop for data safety');
  // await queryInterface.dropTable('users'); // Commented out
}
```

### Issue #2: Duplicate Projects Table ✅ FIXED

- Removed `migrations/013-create-projects.js` (duplicate)
- Kept `migrations/016-create-projects-and-documents.js` (more complete)

### Issue #3: Duplicate estimated_duration Column ✅ FIXED

- Removed `migrations/020-add-estimated-duration-column.js`
- Column already exists in `migrations/002-create-courses.js`

### Issue #4: Conflicting Systems ✅ FIXED

**Before:** Two systems fighting each other
- Migrations folder ←→ create-all-tables.js (sync)
- Caused confusion and data loss

**After:** Clear separation
- Development: Use `sync()` via `db:setup:dev`
- Production: Use migrations via `db:migrate`
- Legacy scripts moved to `legacy:*` commands

## 📖 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time Setup (Development)

```bash
# 1. Create database in PostgreSQL
createdb lms_db

# 2. Configure .env file
DB_DATABASE=lms_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
NODE_ENV=development

# 3. Setup database
npm run db:setup:dev:fresh

# 4. Create admin user
npm run db:create-admin

# 5. Start server
npm start
```

### Scenario 2: Daily Development Work

```bash
# 1. Update a model file
# Edit models/User.js - add new field

# 2. Update database (keeps existing data)
npm run db:setup:dev

# 3. Test your changes
npm start
```

### Scenario 3: Deploying to Production

```bash
# 1. Set production environment
NODE_ENV=production

# 2. Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 3. Verify migrations applied
npm run db:migrate:status

# 4. Start server
npm start
```

### Scenario 4: Rolling Back a Migration

```bash
# Check current status
npm run db:migrate:status

# Undo last migration (safe - doesn't drop tables)
npm run db:migrate:undo

# Verify rollback
npm run db:migrate:status
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Development

1. ✅ Use `db:setup:dev` for daily work
2. ✅ Only use `db:setup:dev:fresh` when you need clean slate
3. ✅ Keep your models up to date
4. ✅ Test schema changes before deploying
5. ❌ Don't use migrations in development (unless testing them)

### For Production

1. ✅ Always use migrations
2. ✅ Test migrations in staging first
3. ✅ Backup database before migrating
4. ✅ Use `db:migrate` (has safety checks)
5. ✅ Monitor migration logs
6. ❌ Never use `sync({ force: true })` in production
7. ❌ Never use `db:setup:dev:fresh` in production

### For Migrations

1. ✅ One migration per logical change
2. ✅ Test both `up` and `down` methods
3. ✅ Include try-catch for index creation
4. ✅ Add comments explaining why
5. ❌ Don't drop tables in `down` methods
6. ❌ Don't combine unrelated changes

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists" Error

```bash
# Check which migrations have run
npm run db:migrate:status

# If table exists but migration says "down"
# The table was created outside migrations
# Options:
# 1. Drop table manually and re-run migration
# 2. Mark migration as complete manually
```

### "Column already exists" Error

This happens when:
- Migration tries to add column that exists
- Models and migrations are out of sync

Solution:
```bash
# Development: Just re-run setup
npm run db:setup:dev:fresh

# Production: Edit migration to check if column exists first
```

### Models and Database Out of Sync

```bash
# Development: Sync from models
npm run db:setup:dev

# Production: Create new migration
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name sync-schema
# Then edit the migration file
```

### Can't Connect to Database

```bash
# Check .env file has correct credentials
DB_DATABASE=lms_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# Test connection manually
psql -U postgres -d lms_db

# Check PostgreSQL is running
# macOS: brew services list
# Linux: systemctl status postgresql
```

## 📚 Understanding Migrations

### What is a Migration?

A migration is a file that describes ONE change to your database schema:

```javascript
// migrations/001-add-phone-to-users.js
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // Forward change: Add column
    await queryInterface.addColumn('users', 'phone', {
      type: Sequelize.STRING(20)
    });
  },
  
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // Reverse change: Remove column (safe - keeps table)
    await queryInterface.removeColumn('users', 'phone');
  }
};
```

### Migration Execution Order

Migrations run in alphabetical/numerical order:

```
001-create-users.js           ← Runs first
002-create-courses.js         ← Runs second
003-create-enrollments.js     ← Runs third
...
035-create-hackathons.js
```

### Tracking Migrations

Sequelize creates a `SequelizeMeta` table to track which migrations have run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "SequelizeMeta";
```

## 🎓 FAQ

**Q: Do I need migrations in development?**  
A: No! Use `db:setup:dev` which is faster and easier. Only use migrations in production.

**Q: Can I edit a migration after it's been run?**  
A: No, once applied in production. Create a new migration instead.

**Q: What happens if a migration fails halfway?**  
A: The migration stops, but changes made before the error remain. You'll need to fix manually or rollback.

**Q: Can I skip a migration?**  
A: Not recommended. Migrations should run in order. If needed, edit the migration to do nothing.

**Q: How do I create a new migration?**  
A: Use `npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name my-change` then edit the generated file.

**Q: What if I accidentally ran migrations in development?**  
A: It's okay! Migrations work in both environments. Just continue using them or reset with `db:setup:dev:fresh`.
